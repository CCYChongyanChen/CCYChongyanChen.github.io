                            <h2>Motivation: The image and question you will see are all from visually impaired people. Our aim is to build a smart system to automatically answer their visual question. However, the image captured from blind people sometimes doesnâ€™t include sufficient information for a computer to answer. Thus, we need you to help us to identify if the visual question requires external knowledge to be answered.</h2>
                            <h3>We ask you to: 
                                carefully read the definition of perception and other 4 external knowledge categories, carefully review images taken by visually impaired people, and then: 
                                (1) answer if the question is a perception question
                                (2) select whavt are the external knowledge needs in the image.
                                (3) If you think you can answer the visual question better than the existing 10 answers, then answer it, we will give your bonus. You can search for Internet for the answer
