                            We ask you to: 
                                carefully review the question and image as well as the existing 10 answers, read the taxonomy of perception and other 3 external knowledge categories,  and then: 
                                <br>(1) Ground the item in the image according to the existing answers
                                <br>(2) Identify if the question is a perception question (doesn't need any external knowledge) or identify which external knowledge(s) are needed in the image.
                                <br>(3) If the image requires partial knowledge or expertise knowledge and you think you can answer the visual question better than the existing 10 answers, then answer it, we will give your bonus. You can search for Internet for the answer

                                <br>PLEASE NOTE: It is possible that some images could be meaningless, inappropriate, or offensive. We cannot control what pictures are taken. Kindly use your best judgement for this task.

                            Since some images captured from blind people donâ€™t include sufficient information for a computer to answer, we need you to help us to identify if the visual question requires external knowledge to be answered and what kinds of external knowledge are needed.
                            <br>(1) Label as <strong>Perception Question</strong> if you think the question can be answered directly based on the information provided by the image without any kind of external knowledge.
                            <br>(2) Label as <strong>common sense</strong> if you think this question can be answered by most of the normal people. Click here to see some examples. 
                            <br>(3) Label a question as <strong>Expertise Knowledge</strong> if you can answer the question but think this question is too hard or is not common sense, OR if you cannot answer the question but thinking some expert of can answer it. Click here to see some examples.
                            <br>(4) Label a question as needing <strong>partial knowledge</strong> if you think the image doesn't include the whole object and you need to interpret it or need external information to complement it. Click here to see some examples.
